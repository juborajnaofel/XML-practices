<!--xml is designed to carry data 

	XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language
	XML is a markup language much like HTML
	XML was designed to store and transport data
	XML was designed to be self-descriptive
	XML is a W3C Recommendation
	XML does not DO anything. XML is just information wrapped in tags
	With XML, the author must define both the tags and the document structure cause tags arent predefined
